Many devices support visually impaired and blind people in spatial navigation, but the problem of enabling meaningful object interaction is neglected. Here, we present an innovative approach, combining an established tactile interface technology, a computer vision system, and modern AI techniques to allow visually impaired and blind people to grasp objects. <br/>
We adapted a tactile belt to enhance spatial navigation of sighted, visually impaired, and blind people [1,2] to a bracelet worn on the wrist. The bracelet is connected to a microcontroller and includes four motors for cueing up/down/left/right directions. A PC captures the video stream supplied by a camera mounted on a standard bicycle helmet. Either the experimenter or a computer vision system translates the hand's and object's relative positions to the required movement direction. This is relayed to the bracelet, guiding the participant toward the desired object. <br/>
We tested the design with single objects in the first series of experiments. We found that a placement directly on the ulnar is unfavorable and leads to confusion of down and left/right signals. Moving the tactile element off the bone onto the soft issue resolved this problem. Further, once an appropriate hand position is reached, we found the pulsed activation of tactile elements a suitable signal initiating forward movement and the cessation of the vibration to initiate the grasp proper. <br/>
In the second experiment, the participant performed the task of grasping a variety of objects, easily identifiable colorful artificial fruits. Sighted people perform this task in a fraction of a second. Our participants were performing the task blindfolded with auditory instructions and required an average of 4.3s until a successful grasp. With tactile guidance, a successful grasp was achieved within 6.1s on average. <br/>
These results demonstrate the feasibility of tactile guidance of grasping movements. In the present design, performance is slightly slower than with auditory instructions. However, the system increases the self-reliance of the participants, a property highly valued by visually impaired and blind people. Further improvements, such as a predictive computation of the guiding signal that compensates for the human reaction time, hold the prospect of enhancing system performance further. <br/>
