4,f,28,AT,Piper,Milad,White,Left,No,27.02.2023,1549,1645,1,100,"Since the task requires atttention, if particpants are tired, the RT is higher. 
Some fruits required differnt grasping motion (for example, orange if the participants not carefull will fly away from position). 
Since the eyes are blindfolded, the participant reported that their sense of smell has been heightened (They could smell the 2nd experimenter's perfume!!!)
When in the right position to grasp fruit, it is much easier not to wait for command and just grasp but particpants were expliclty asked to wait, this took some controling.
